Write a program that converts expressions to assembly language. You have an input file that includes expression lines. So you will convert the file to an assembly file using java data structures.

Spesific Restrictions:
- Convert the infix expressions to postfix form.
- After getting postfix expressions, you should convert each operation to assembly instructions and registers.
- After all conversion you should save your assembly code to .asm file. You can test your code in mars editor.
- You should also check some unconditional situations (such as, undefined variable usage,division by zero, uncompitable type, out of register limit..).
- You should use only java list and stack and also you can create your data structures. 
- You should use only these registers : [$t0-$t8,$a0,$v1] and instructions in table in the pdf.
