- PART I:

Use HuffmanCode class which described in the text book add encode method which gets string and return its Huffman codes sequences.

- PART II:

Implement iterator class which iterate binarySearchTree which implemented in the book. Your iterator traverse tree ascending order.

- PART III:

Use given priority queue interface and implement your priority queue class. Your priority queue stores any type data. To use priority property for priority queue use and implement compareto function/class which described comparable interface in java.

A priority queue can be implementing using a variety of data structures, each with different tradeoffs between memory required, runtime performance, complexity of code, etc. In this homework, you will consider four different implementations; unsorted vector, array list, linked list which implemented in java and binary search tree which implemented in the book.

Create a test class which create random data sequences (sequence size like 10, 100, 1000, 10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000) and test your four priority queue implementation running time performance. Create a table and give comparable benchmark table.
