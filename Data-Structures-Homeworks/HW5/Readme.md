Part 1: Implement the Towers of Hanoi problem iteratively. Your prototype should be:
- public  void TowerOfHanoi(disksize,src,dst,aux)

Part 2: Implement the remove procedure from LinkListRec class but your procedure removes all duplicate elements in linked list.
Your prototype should be:
- public boolean remove(Node < E > head, Node < E > pred, E outData)

Part 3: Implement a class that have two sorted array,list1 and list2.You should write 3 recursive procedure that do some operations on these lists. 
Your prototypes should be:
- public List intersectionOfLists(); //returns intersection set as a list of list1 and list 2
- public List unionOfLists(); //returns union set as a list of list1 and list 2  
- public boolean isSubset(); //return true if list2 is subset of list1
