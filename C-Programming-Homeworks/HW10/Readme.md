Implementation of  a simple program to process some appointment data of some patients. All appointments start at the beginning of an hour. Basically, code:
- Read some appointment records from a records file (binary file) into a dynamically allocated array (Part1),
- Build a linked-list holding the valid appointment records in this array (Part 2),
- Handle the following operations on the link-list :
- Adding patient history, taken from the patients file (text file), to each appointment in the list (Part 2),
- Deleting a list of canceled appointments, taken from a delete file (text file) (Part 2),
- Deallocating the dynamic data (Part 2),
- Making an independent copy of the list (Part 3).
