- You will write a recursive function that finds and returns size of a string. 

int find_size(const char *string)
- Using the function above write a new function that finds how many times a given string is used in a given string.

int char_number(const char *string, const char *wish_to_find)
- Assume every Friday, you have to climb n stairs for C lab on the first floor. You can take your steps as follow: One stair at a time or two stairs at a time. You will write a complete C program to calculate in how many distinct ways you can climb to the top and to print it on the screen.

Your program will include at least two functions as following :
- int combination (int n , int k) : a recursive function to calculate combination
“n choose k” and returns the result.
- int ways (int n) : write a recursive function to calculate and return total number of
ways.
